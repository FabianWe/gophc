# gophc
A library to parse and create P-H-C strings.

The [PHC string format](https://github.com/P-H-C/phc-string-format) defines
a "standard" for string encodings for the output of a password hashing function.

gophc is a pure Go implementation of this standard.

**Disclaimer**: No warranty or anything that it implements the standard 100%!
